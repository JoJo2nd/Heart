Most deps are included by in the repo. But the following will need to be downloaded

*) wxWidgets-2.9.4 from http://www.wxwidgets.org. Get version wxWidget-2.9.4.zip not the installer. extract the source to external/wxWidgets-2.9.4
    Download the binaries for 2.9.4 and extract them to external/wxWidgets-2.9.4/lib. Pick the correct verion (vs2008 is vc90, vs2010 is vc100)
    Make sure to get both dev and release binary packages
    If you're really brave you can try building wxWidgets from source...good luck :)

*) boost from http://www.boost.org. Get version 1_48 again as an zip not an installer. extract the source to external/boost

*) Install python 2.7 and add the environment variable PYTHON_ROOT to point to the path with python.exe in it

*) OpenAL needs to be installed. It can be found in external/openal/redist

*) DXSDK is also needed

*) run the build/build_all_external_libs.bat to compile any external libs that need to be built
   -- or --
   run build/build_mega_all.bat to compile every project in the repo, this should leave you with a number or ready to run *.exes
