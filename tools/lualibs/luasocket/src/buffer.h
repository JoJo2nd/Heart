* Input/Output interface for Lua programs
* LuaSocket toolkit
*
* Line patterns require buffering. Reading one character at a time involves
* too many system calls and is very slow. This module implements the
* LuaSocket interface for input/output on connected objects, as seen by 
* Lua programs. 
*
* Input is buffered. Output is *not* buffered because there was no simple
* way of making sure the buffered output data would ever be sent.
*
* The module is built on top of the I/O abstraction defined in io.h and the
* timeout management is done with the timeout.h interface.
